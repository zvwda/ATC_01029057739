MongoDB for database management

✨ Core Functionality
🔐 Role-Based Access Control
Admins and users have distinct permissions for security and functionality.

📝 Event Management
Admins can manage events with full CRUD operations.

🏗️ Modular Backend Architecture
The backend follows a scalable, feature-based folder structure.

🧪 Skills Demonstrated
Frontend: React

Backend: Express.js, Node.js, MongoDB, REST API development

UI/UX: Responsive layout, multilingual support, accessible design

🚀 How to Run the Project Locally
Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

1. Start the Backend
  cd Backend
  npm install
  nodemon server.js
Replace server.js with your actual main file name if different (e.g., app.js or index.js).

3. Start the Frontend
Open a new terminal window/tab and run:

   cd Frontend
   npm install
   npm start
The frontend should now be running on http://localhost:3000 and connected to your backend.

🙌 Final Note
Thank you for checking out EventMate!
I’m currently balancing this work alongside my exam period, which has been a challenge, but I remained committed to delivering functional and well-structured code.
I’m excited to bring this experience to Areeb Technology and continue growing as a developer. 🚀
